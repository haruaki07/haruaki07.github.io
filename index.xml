Currently living in Indonesia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly I work on the server-side, but I love to do some client-side too. I&amp;rsquo;m also exploring cloud technologies (AWS, GCP) and DevOps practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD, though I&amp;rsquo;m still developing my expertise in these areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a lifelong learner, I dream of contributing to the developer community by giving talks or mentoring others. I hope to achieve this soon, as sharing my knowledge and helping others is something I truly enjoy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
