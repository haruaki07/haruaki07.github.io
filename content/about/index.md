I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong experience in web development, particularly back-end systems for over 2 years. Currently living in Indonesia.

Mostly I work on the server-side, but I love to do some client-side too. I'm also exploring cloud technologies (AWS, GCP) and DevOps practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD, though I'm still developing my expertise in these areas.

As a lifelong learner, I dream of contributing to the developer community by giving talks or mentoring others. I hope to achieve this soon, as sharing my knowledge and helping others is something I truly enjoy.

In short, it's me, Misbahul Khoiri, a programmer from Indonesia. You can read a story about me becoming a software engineer [here](/posts).
