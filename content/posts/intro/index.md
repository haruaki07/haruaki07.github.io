This is my personal website, intended to share my thoughts, experiences, and portfolios.

## Why did I made this?

Before I made this, I actually have created my personal website over two years ago, but I haven't updated it. I've been too lazy to write articles or blog posts. I just put my GitHub link on the contact page and hoping that people find me and look at my work there.

However, I realized that I'm not that special, I'm not "that person". I need to let others know who I am, and having a personal site feels like a great way to put myself out there. It’s a chance to share my journey, showcase my work, and create something that reflects who I am. It’s also a way to stay motivated and track my growth as I continue to learn and explore new things in tech.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be "that person". Just take the positive aspects and follow what can help you grow. Everyone has their own path to success.
